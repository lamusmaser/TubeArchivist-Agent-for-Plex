# TubeArchivist-Agent-for-Plex
Agent for Plex that allows TubeArchivist to integrate.

Heavily influenced by [Zero QI's YouTube-Agent](https://github.com/ZeroQI/YouTube-Agent.bundle) and [JordyAlkema's Youtube-DL-Agent](https://github.com/JordyAlkema/Youtube-DL-Agent.bundle), this project creates an integration path for [TubeArchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist) to integrate with Plex Media Server.

This is currently a work-in-progress and is not ready for use. Anyone willing to help with the project (development or testing) is encouraged to do so.
